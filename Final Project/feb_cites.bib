@article{Bursztyn2017,
abstract = {Many people care about how they are perceived by those around them. Several recent field experiments in economics have found that such social image concerns can have powerful effects on a range of behaviors. In this article, we first review this recent literature aimed at identifying social image concerns or social pressure. We then highlight and discuss two important areas that have been comparatively less well explored in this literature: understanding social pressure, including the underlying mechanisms, and whether such pressure can be shaped or influenced.},

@article{DellaVigna2016,
abstract = {Why do people vote? We design a field experiment to estimate a model of voting 'because others will ask'. The expectation of being asked motivates turnout if individuals derive pride from telling others that they voted, or feel shame from admitting that they did not vote, provided that lying is costly. In a door-to-door survey about election turnout, we experimentally vary (i) the informational content and use of a flyer pre-announcing the survey, (ii) the duration and payment for the survey, and (iii) the incentives to lie about past voting. The experimental results indicate significant social image concerns. For the 2010 Congressional election, we estimate a value of voting 'to tell others' of about {\$}15, contributing 2 percentage points to turnout. Lastly, we evaluate a get-out-the-vote intervention in which we tell potential voters that we will ask if they voted.},

abstract = {Voter education campaigns often aim to increase voter participation and political account-ability. Randomized interventions were implemented nationwide during the 2009 Mozambi-can elections using lea ets, text messaging, and a free newspaper. We study the local peer e¤ecs triggered by the campaign. We investigate whether treatment e¤ects are transmit-ted through social networks and geographical proximity at the village level. For individuals personally targeted by the campaign, we estimate the reinforcement e¤ect of proximity to other individuals in our sample. For untargeted individuals, we estimate how the campaign di¤uses as a function of proximity to others in the sample. We {\ldots}nd evidence for both e¤ects, similar across treatments and proximity measures. The campaign raises the level of interest We wish to thank Jenny Aker, Oriana Bandiera, C{\'{a}}tia Batista, Paul Collier, Eliana La Ferrara, Ted Miguel, Gerard Padro-i-Miquel, and Imran Rasul for helpful suggestions. Miguel Ferreira provided superb research assis-tance. We also wish to thank participants in seminars at LSE/UCL, Stanford, ULB, and UNU-MERIT, and at the MOVE, SITE, NEUDC, and North-American Winter Meeting of the Econometric Society conferences for useful comments. We are particularly grateful to newspaper @Verdade, AMODE, Observat{\'{o}}rio Eleitoral and STAE for fruitful collaboration. Shenga o¤ered crucial inputs to this project for which we are most thankful. Finally, we would like to extend a word to the fantastic work o¤ered by supervisors Eg{\'{i}}dio Chaimite, Alberto da Cruz, Eg{\'{i}}dio Guambe, and Aqu{\'{i}}lcia Samuel, and the group of enumerators with whom we worked: their dedication to this project was critical to its success. We wish to acknowledge {\ldots}nancial support from the Tel: +351-21-3801601. in the election through networks, in line with the average treatment e¤ect. However, we {\ldots}nd a negative network e¤ect of the treatment on voter participation, implying that the positive e¤ect of treatment on more central individuals is smaller. We interpret this result as consistent with free-riding through pivotal reasoning and we provide additional evidence to support this claim.},

@article{Gerber2008,
abstract = {Voter turnout theories based on rational self-interested behavior generally fail to predict significant turnout unless they account for the utility that citizens receive from performing their civic duty. We distinguish between two aspects of this type of utility, intrinsic satisfaction from behaving in accordance with a norm and extrinsic incentives to comply, and test the effects of priming intrinsic motives and applying varying degrees of extrinsic pressure. A large-scale field experiment involving several hundred thousand registered voters used a series of mailings to gauge these effects. Substantially higher turnout was observed among those who received mailings promising to publicize their turnout to their household or their neighbors. These findings demonstrate the profound importance of social pressure as an inducement to political participation.},

@article{Manski1993,
abstract = {This paper examines the reflection problem that arises when a researcher observing the distribution of behaviour in a population tries to infer whether the average behaviour in some group influences the behaviour of the individuals that comprise the group. It is found that inference is not possible unless the researcher has prior information specifying the composition of reference groups. If this information is available, the prospects for inference depend critically on the population relationship between the variables defining reference groups and those directly affecting outcomes. Inference is difficult to impossible if these variables are functionally dependent or are statistically independent. The prospects are better if the variables defining reference groups and those directly affecting outcomes are moderately related in the population.},

We randomized features of the letters and measured the effects of these variations on the recipients' subsequent contributions. We find that making an individual's contributions more visible to her neighbors increases the contributions of supporters of the local majority party and decreases those of supporters of the minority party. Individuals contribute more when they perceive higher average contributions from own-party supporters in their area and contribute less if there is a higher share of own-party contributors.},
